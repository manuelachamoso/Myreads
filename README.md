# About my project
## Project Title
This project was created by Udacity for the Senior Front End Engineer - OLX Scholarship nanodegree. We were given a code called starter where we would either develop our code from there or start from scratch. I have started from the code that was given to me.

**Getting Started:**
- In order to install all project depedencies:
```sh
npm install
